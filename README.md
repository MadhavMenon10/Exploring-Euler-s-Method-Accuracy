# Exploring-Euler-s-Method-Accuracy-

This project was completed as part of my Extended Essay component in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program. This project aims to investigate the accuracy of Euler's Method in approximating solutions to inhomogenous differential equations --- namely the differential equation that governs the series RL circuit. The differential equation was first derived using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law and the analytical solution was obtained using the Laplace Transform. Euler's Method was then implemented in Python to approximate the solution to the differential equation and a circuit simulation was carried out using PySpice to verify the approximation. The error-bound term in Euler's Method was subsequently derived. All theorems used have been proved.
